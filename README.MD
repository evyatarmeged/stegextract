# Stegextract
Bash script to extract hidden files and strings from images.

## Description
Stegextract extracts any trailing data after the image's closing bytes, and any hidden files (or other images) embedded within the image.<br>
Short byte combinations such as JPEG's `FFD8 FFE0` might sometimes create false positives.<br>
Manually reviewing the hexdump is sometimes inevitable in cases of highly complex embedded files.<br>
Stegextract is not the solution for any color/pixel/filter/LSB related Steganography, nor does it try to be. It
relies on magic numbers, hexdumps and binary data alone.<br>
Currently supports PNG, JPG, and GIF.

**Update**: `--analyze` flag was deprecated and is now being performed automatically with every scan.
